Compile:
In command line, You can enter "make" to compile the program. It requires the following packages to compile:
Armadillo:
WinGLPK:
pthread:

Input Format:
The input of NewPolyVest is the H-representation of a polyhedron with rational coefficients. To describe the polytope
{ b >= Ax } in n-dimensional space, where b is an m*1 vector and A is an m*n matrix, the corresponding input
file is given by 2 + m * n numbers.

The first two numbers in the input file must be:
   m  n+1
which are the row and column number of the following data.
Each row of the following data has (n+2) data and define an inequality in { b >= Ax }. For example, the ith inequality
appears in the input as follows:
   b_i  -a_{i1}  -a_{i2} ...  -a_{in} 

Example:
To illustrate the input file format, let us consider the simple example of the square: {(x,y) | -1 <= x <= 1, -1 <= y <= 1}.
This input file is given by:
 4   2
 1   1   0
 1  -1   0
 1   0   1
 1   0  -1

Using NewPolyVest:
To use NewPolyVest, you need to run "make" in the command line first to compile the program. Then you will get an exe file named "MCS".
You may run NewPolyVest as follows:
./NewPolyVest [input-file] [sample-number] [threshold] [thread-number] <output-file>

The input-file is in the format described before. The sample-number is the number of randomly generated directions. The threshold is a number we set to control error. Usually, we set threshold to be 0.1 .
The output-file is optional. NewPolyVest will append the result to file 'NewPolyVest.result' by default.
